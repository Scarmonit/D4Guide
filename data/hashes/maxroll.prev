divine intervention blood wave necromancer the season 11 theme is sanctification. sanctifying your gear at hadriel's forge has the chance to add new stats, greater affixes or even legendary aspects while rendering the item unmodifiable. you can no longer temper, masterwork, enchant, add sockets or imprint sanctified items, but you can swap out gems and runes. this is the final big gamble on your gear, with a small chance of swapping an affix to something undesirable. make sure to have a replacement item, or to sanctify potential gear instead of the items you've equipped. best outcomes many added affixes or aspects you get on your gear can be a massive boost in power, utility or survivability. the aspects are limited to the same that an item can typically have. aspects: ‍conceited, ‍vehement brawler's, ‍edgemaster's, ‍elemental fate, ‍fastblood, ‍exposed flesh, ‍starlight, ‍potent blood, ‍hardened bones affixes: all skill ranks - shadow damage - intelligence % - intelligence/all stats - attack speed - cooldown reduction masterworking quality increase; second best outcome on a weapon is to sanctify additional quality. the max roll of 25% is worth nearly x40% damage multiplier. by defeating the lesser evils andariel, duriel, azmodan and belial, you unlock corrupted essences. these increase rewards and danger in undercity, helltide, world bosses and the pit, respectively. progressing the seasonal reputation board unlocks purified essences, which also increase rewards while granting a small character buff. both corrupted and purified can be slotted in for even more rewards. feel free to adjust these choices as needed to optimize your farming strategy and to leave out corrupted essences if you are feeling overwhelmed by their downsides! blood wave divine gifts season 11 - divine intervention blood wave necromancer ‍blood wave is the main damage dealer. when cast, this skill does massive aoe overpower damage while pushing enemies, reducing damage taken, generating blood orbs to provide healing and cooldown reduction. ‍decrepify applies a powerful cc effect that also causes lucky hit procs to reduce cooldowns on your skills. this skill is not slotted on your skill bar since you don't manually cast this ability manually, ‍cursed aura or the ‍wat rune does the job for you! ‍blight adds a x10% damage scaler to targets in its puddle. ‍corpse explosion consumes corpses to trigger ‍grim harvest, ‍fueled by death ‍blood mist is a great skill to increase your damage via ‍dreadful blood mist but also granting you immunity and unstoppable to move around through mobs collecting blood orbs. via ‍enhanced blood mist passive reduces the cooldown of ‍blood mist as your ‍blood wave overpowers. ‍sever is only on the skill bar to increase damage and movement speed via ‍reaper's pursuit. end game 71 1/5 reap decompose 1/5 supernatural blight 3/3 1/5 dreadful blood mist 1/5 blighted corpse explosion 3/3 3/3 3/3 3/3 1/5 abhorrent decrepify 3/3 3/3 2/3 3/3 3/3 3/3 3/3 3/3 3/3 5/5 supreme blood wave 3/3 3/3 3/3 blood wave necromancer endgame skill tree once you are in range, you cast ‍blood wave to start your damage rotation. the lucky hits of ‍blood wave make targets vulnerable (you need to have one of your affixes on your rings to be "lucky hit chance to make enemies vulnerable for 2 seconds") and creates corpses by procing ‍hewed flesh. ‍tidal casts 2 additional ‍blood waves, doing even more damage and giving you more orbs to collect. tidal has an animation lock, meaning you can't cast another ‍blood wave even with a fully reset cooldown until the ‍tidal animation finishes. this interval creates the perfect opportunity to pick up blood orbs and weave in other skills such as corpse explosion, blight and blood mist. simple rotation is as follows: cast blood wave > corpse explosion to consume a corpse, blight to activate extra shadow damage, blood mist to be immune and unstoppable to collect orbs, cast blood wave again and repeat. blood orbs resets the timer for ‍rathma's vigor causing ‍blood wave to do overpower damage. as long as you stay healthy for 15 seconds, ‍rathma's vigor causes ‍blood wave to overpower. consuming blood orbs decreases this 15 second timer to overpower more frequently. warning: blood mist can consume your rathma's vigor proc, so do not use mist if you have 15 stacks of rathma's vigor unless you really need to, to survive. the blood wave necromancer chooses to sacrifice ‍skeletal warriors - reapers for extra shadow damage, ‍skeletal mages - bone for the massive increase to overpower damage and ‍golems - iron for critical strike damage bonus. early in your progression you sacrifice ‍skeletal warriors - skirmishers to reach 100% critical strike chance. if you're feeling squishy or playing on hardcore, sacrificing ‍ ‍golems - blood for maximum life and ‍ ‍skeletal warriors - defenders for resistances are great ways to beef up your survivability. book of the dead season 11 -
